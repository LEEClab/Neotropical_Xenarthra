Xenarthrans – anteaters, sloths, and armadillos – have essential functions for ecosystem maintenance, such as insect control and nutrient cycling, playing key roles as ecosystem engineers. The Neotropical Xenarthra has more de 40,000 records of 31 species, represented by occurrence and quantitative data, totaling 24,847 unique georeferenced records. The geographic range is from the south of the USA, Mexico, and Caribbean countries at the northern portion of the Neotropics, to its austral distribution in Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay.  The original dataset is fully available at ECOLOGY repository. Updated version of NEOTROPICAL XENARTHRA can be accessed in this NEOTROPICAL SERIES Github repository.
